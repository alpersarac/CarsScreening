When you run the application please wait for the page load
When you see green box you are ready to click to start button
Wait for the message box at the end of the progress which shows "Process has been completed please check output file in BIN folder"
There will be a folder that you find json files.


Additionally, process just works one time. it doesn't repeat the process.
There is an issue on the website, car models don't show up on the combobox when you browse the website google chrome incognito mode. As described in the case
I can't see "tesla" option on the models <select option> hence I choose "ford" instead.
